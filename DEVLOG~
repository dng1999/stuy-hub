	wrote code for execPipe -> currently only tests to see if input is correct
		need to add calls to execRedir later
	      
dorothyN -- 9:00 PM
	fixed execPipe
		still need to add calls to execRedir later (they're commented out until execRedir is working)

nancyC -- 10:14 PM
       > redirection works
       working on < redirection

nancyC -- 11:23 PM
       < redirection works
       will do further test cases

>>1/13/17

dorothyN -- 11:43 AM
	 actually fixed execPipe this time and will run on Mac OS. Not Linux. ???

>>1/16/17 

nancyC -- 11:01 PM
	coded "git lazy <commit msg>" command that git add . -> git commit -m <commit msg> -> git push in one step
	must relearn/refresh knowledge on semaphores..
	now works with and without commit message input from user!

       fixed weird error - redirection now works on linux yay! 

>> 1/18/17

dorothyN -- 8:37 AM
	 modified networking code to only accept one connection at a time
	 issue: server shuts down when client shuts down
	 	server has to be rerun after every session
nancyC -- 12:08 PM 
       fixed double exit bug
       git log is now reformatted to be clearer
       clear terminal when server or client is run
       added signal handling for Ctrl+C
       
>> 1/19/17

dorothyN -- 3:40 PM
	got networking to work so that only one client can run at a time
	will upload later b/c merge conflicts over the horizon (my nemesis)

dorothyN -- 6:52 PM
	 still need to make it so that ./shm runs automatically
	       will probably have prompt asking user if they want to shut down
	       the server or not
	 need to combine s3rver and networking folders
	 need to combine ^^^ and shell
	      command line = client
	      execr.c = server processing

>>1/20/17

nancyC -- 11:17 AM
       git log doesn't require double exit now

dorothyN -- 11:41 AM
	 combined shell and s3rver for the most part
	 need to make it so that 'exit' prompts user input on whether to shut
	 down server or not

	 nancy wants to make client wait if too many clients

       s3rver can compile!!
       bug found: client doesn't exit when server exits
